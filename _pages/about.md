My name is Xiaofeng Liu (Chinese name: "刘 晓 凤") and I am currently earning my Ph.D. in [Water Resource Institude](http://gwri.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) under the advisement of [Dr. Aris Georgakakos](http://gwri.gatech.edu/staff/3976). The focus of my research is reservoir system management both for quantity and quality.
